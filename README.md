# Coal-seam-model
To give a graphical 3-D view of coal seam model. It will be beneficial for Mining and Excavation.
We will a create a plugin(.dll file) for AutoCAD which will take BoreHole log data from the user and create a 3D view of coal seam model in AutoCAD.
Working Platform- Autodesk AutoCAD
Development Environment- Microsoft Visual Basic
Language Required- C#
When the plugin(.dll) is called from AutoCAD, a window form will appear that will ask user for the borehole log data.
The data must be in the form of '.csv' files.
After that the plugin will join all the lower points of the coal seam layer by triangulation technique.
Same will be done for the upper layer of the coal seam.
Finally we will have a compleate coal seam model.

Advantage- This plugin will be  the best alternative to the very high priced simulation softwares used in mining processes.
