# idea for codefundo++
This idea will help 'Rescue team' to easily know where and how many people are stuck in disaster region.
Technologies that are required- GPS, Android Studio or Microsoft Visual basic, 3D mapping software like CAD or Google maps.
How it will work?
- Now almost everyone have a smartphone therefore the idea is workable.
- It will be an smartphone app that can ease rescuing process.
- If any person got stuck in natural calamity say flood, he can use that app which sends his exact location through to the server.
- In the same way many other affected person can also use that app and send their respective location.
- Now, the app will take all the locations (as cordinates) and plot it to the map of the affected area as red points.
- This will help the rescue team (especially helicopters) to easily locate the red dots and provide help to them.
- They can also get the numbers of victims stuck in a particular area. For example- in case of flood, foods are dropped to the affected people with the help of helicopters. So if they know the number of affected people, they can provide adequate and efficient help.  
- In the same way the affected people can also get the location of the 'Rescuers' & other affected people in that region.

Additional Features
- This app should be preloaded to every smartphone where natural disasters are more likely to happen.  
- Users can login with their names and details for more efficient working of the app. In this way the rescue team will have the knowledge about location, number and details of the affected people.

Advantages
- Working of the Rescue Team will be more planned therefore less economic loss.
- Since the app works on GPS, it will work flawlessly even in the case of network failure.
